# ie11_tls1_2
Registry Edit changed for TLS 1.2 
*Summary:*
This program was created to add registry keys to enable TLS 1.2 security features in Window 7-10. This was written in Go, because it can be compiled into a portable executable binary. This ensure consistent execution and ability to sign if an organization has a signing mechanism for .exe.
